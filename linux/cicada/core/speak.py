"""同声传译 (the Mac's 说): what I say into my microphone, interpreted and spoken into the meeting.

Each sentence (cut by the same Segmenter as listening) goes to the AI service's hear model (Ming on
Ling), which returns what was said and its translation in one call; the translation is voiced by the
service's speech model (Ming's TTS on Ling) and played
into 知了 麦克风, the virtual microphone the meeting app uses. Sentences play one after another, in
order. A sentence that couldn't be interpreted is never spoken (AGENTS.md: never speak untranslated
text into the room).

Without headphones my microphone also hears the other side through the speakers. The app reads it
through the sound server's echo canceller when it can (app/room.py), which takes their voices out, so
what I say over them goes out. From the plain microphone, a sentence heard while the system audio was
loud for most of it is dropped instead, so the room doesn't get its own words back. UI-free like
ListenEngine: on_change is called on worker threads."""
