# Changelog

One section per release, newest first; one version covers every platform. `scripts/release.sh`
writes it from the `feat:` and `fix:` commits since the last tag, grouped by platform (the commit's
scope), and the release workflow publishes it as the release notes. Since 1.1.2 every release ships
every platform (one with nothing new says No changes); earlier ones shipped only those listed. Lines under `## Unreleased` become the release's summary. The Chinese changelog for users is `site/changelog.json`.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-11-03

The first public release. Cicada turns whatever your Mac plays into live translated subtitles and meeting notes, keeps each meeting as a bilingual record, and speaks what you say back into the meeting in the other side's language.

### Highlights

- Live bilingual subtitles for any app that plays sound, with on-device speech recognition that detects the spoken language
- Live meeting notes with a Ling key: a summary, topics, conclusions, to-dos, names and terms, and a fishbone diagram when causes are discussed
- Meetings saved as bilingual records with the notes beside the original lines, exported to Markdown, Word or SRT, and ended by themselves when the call hangs up or goes quiet
- Interpreting: hold right ⌥ to talk, and Cicada speaks the translation into the meeting through BlackHole 2ch with a Ming voice, a Mac voice or your own, switching the system mic for you
- Speaker identification (experimental) tells the other side's voices apart and, with a Ling key, fills in their names
- The live notes window stays out of screen sharing unless you choose to show it
- English, Japanese, Korean and Chinese interface, a four-step first-run guide, and in-app updates checked against each release's SHA-256
